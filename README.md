# Bullet-Hell

my very first attempt at making a bullet hell game.

i learnt how hard making a game is through this, but that didn't completely stop me.

life gave me a knuckle sandwich and forced me to never revisit this.

most noteable thing here is that there is a delaunay triangulation algorithm. i had to read the original paper (i believe it was the original, delaunay's name was written on it) and translate the english-written algorithm to C# code.

i lost count on how many hours i spent, lol. it was fun while i lasted at least.
